## Purpose

I believe the purpose of this assignment was to imitate a real world situation if I were to be a professional web developer. 

I learned how to consolidate repetitve code into classes and combinators, when to use ids, and how to add alt text to images.

I learned to google questions I didn't learn how to answer and keep trying my best to make my code better.
